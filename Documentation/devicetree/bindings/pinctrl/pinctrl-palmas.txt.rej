+- ti,palmas-override-powerhold: This is applicable for PMICs for which
+	GPIO7 is configured in POWERHOLD mode which has higher priority
+	over DEV_ON bit and keeps the PMIC supplies on even after the DEV_ON
+	bit is turned off. This property enables driver to over ride the
+	POWERHOLD value to GPIO7 so as to turn off the PMIC in power off
+	scenarios. So for GPIO7 if ti,palmas-override-powerhold is set
+	then the GPIO_7 field should never be muxed to anything else.
+	It should be set to POWERHOLD by default and only in case of
+	power off scenarios the driver will over ride the mux value.
