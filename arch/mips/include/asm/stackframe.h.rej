+		 * Flush interAptiv's Return Prediction Stack (RPS) by writing
+		 * EntryHi. Toggling Config7.RPS is slower and less portable.
+		 *
+		 * The RPS isn't automatically flushed when exceptions are
+		 * taken, which can result in kernel mode speculative accesses
+		 * to user addresses if the RPS mispredicts. That's harmless
+		 * when user and kernel share the same address space, but with
+		 * EVA the same user segments may be unmapped to kernel mode,
+		 * even containing sensitive MMIO regions or invalid memory.
+		 *
+		 * This can happen when the kernel sets the return address to
+		 * ret_from_* and jr's to the exception handler, which looks
+		 * more like a tail call than a function call. If nested calls
+		 * don't evict the last user address in the RPS, it will
+		 * mispredict the return and fetch from a user controlled
+		 * address into the icache.
+		 *
+		 * More recent EVA-capable cores with MAAR to restrict
+		 * speculative accesses aren't affected.
